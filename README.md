### Lucky Number X

In this game, the application will randomly select a sample size of numbers. Within that sample size, a random number will be selected as the 'winner'.

Your goal is to find the 'winner' programmatically with as few guesses as possible. Each guess will return one of two results: 

- Your guess was correct and you win
- The lucky number is higher or lower than the value you guessed

Write a function that consistently finds the lucky number with the least number of guesses.
