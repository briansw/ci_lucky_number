### Lucky Number X

In this game, the application randomly chooses a sample size of numbers. Within the sample, a number at random will be deemed the lucky number and assigned the class ```lucky```.

Your goal is to find the lucky number programmatically with as few guesses as possible. Each guess will return one of two results: 

- You win!
- The lucky number is ```higher``` or ```lower``` than the value you guessed

Write a function that consistently finds the lucky number with the least number of guesses.
